In the last episode, I have showed a rather important limitation of the `tiny-interp`
interpreter:

```python
def cond():
	x = 3
	if x < 5:
		return "yes"
	else:
		return "no"
```

Control flow and function calls were not handled, as a result `tiny-interp` could
not interpret the above code fragment.

In the following, I'll ditch `tiny-interp` and switch to the "real" `pygo`
interpreter.

## Real Python bytecode

People having read the AOSA article know that the structure of the bytecode of
the `tiny-interp` interpreter instruction set is in fact very similar to the
one of the real python bytecode.

Indeed, if one defines the above `cond()` function in a `python3` prompt and
enters:

```python
### bytecode as raw bytes
>>> print(cond.__code__.co_code)
b'd\x01\x00}\x00\x00|\x00\x00d\x02\x00k\x00\x00r\x16\x00d\x03
\x00Sd\x04\x00Sd\x00\x00S'

### bytecode as numbers
>>> print(list(cond.__code__.co_code))
[100, 1, 0, 125, 0, 0, 124, 0, 0, 100, 2, 0, 107,
0, 0, 114, 22, 0, 100, 3, 0, 83, 100, 4, 0, 83,
100, 0, 0, 83]
```

This doesn't look very human friendly.
Luckily, there is the `dis` module that can ingest low-level bytecode
and prints it in a more human-readable way:

```python
>>> import dis
>>> dis.dis(cond)
  2           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (3)
              3 STORE_FAST               0 (x)

  3           6 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              9 LOAD_CONST               2 (5)
             12 COMPARE_OP               0 (<)
             15 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE       22

  4          18 LOAD_CONST               3 ('yes')
             21 RETURN_VALUE

  6     >>   22 LOAD_CONST               4 ('no')
             25 RETURN_VALUE
             26 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
             29 RETURN_VALUE
```

Have a look at the official [`dis`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html)
module documentation for more informations.
In a nutshell, the `LOAD_CONST` is the same than our toy `OpLoadValue` and `LOAD_FAST`
is the same than our toy `OpLoadName`.

Simply inspecting this little bytecode snippet shows how conditions and branch-y
code might be handled.
The instruction `POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE` implements the `if x < 5` statement from the
`cond()` function.
If the condition is `false` (_i.e.:_ `x` is greater or equal than `5`), the interpreter
is instructed to jump to position `22` in the bytecode stream, _i.e._ the `return "no"`
body of the `false` branch.
Loops are handled pretty much the same way:

```python
>>> def loop():
...     x = 1
...     while x < 5:
...             x = x + 1
...     return x
... 
>>> dis.dis(loop)
  2           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (1)
              3 STORE_FAST               0 (x)

  3           6 SETUP_LOOP              26 (to 35)
        >>    9 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
             12 LOAD_CONST               2 (5)
             15 COMPARE_OP               0 (<)
             18 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE       34

  4          21 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
             24 LOAD_CONST               1 (1)
             27 BINARY_ADD
             28 STORE_FAST               0 (x)
             31 JUMP_ABSOLUTE            9
        >>   34 POP_BLOCK

  5     >>   35 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
             38 RETURN_VALUE
```

The above bytecode dump should be rather self-explanatory.
Except perhaps for the `RETURN_VALUE` instruction: where does the
instruction return to?

To answer this, a new concept must be introduced: the `Frame`.

## Frames

As the AOSA article puts it:

   _A frame is a collection of information[s] and context for a chunk of code._

Whenever a function is called, a new `Frame` is created, carrying a *data stack*
(the local variables we have played with so far) and a *block stack* (to handle
control flow such as loops and exceptions.)

The `RETURN_VALUE` instructs the interpreter to pass a value between `Frames`,
from the callee's data stack back to the caller's data stack.

I'll show the `pygo` implementation of a `Frame` in a moment.

## Pygo components

Still following the blueprints of AOSA and `byterun`, `pygo` is built on
the following types:

- a `VM` (virtual machine) which manages the high-level structures (call stack
  of frames, mapping of instructions to operations, etc...).
  The `VM` is a slightly more complex version of the previous `Interpreter`
  type from `tiny-interp`,

- a `Frame`: every `Frame` value contains a code value and manages some state
  (such as the global and local namespaces, a pointer to the calling `Frame`
  and the last bytecode instruction executed),

- a `Function` to model real Python functions: this is to correctly handle
  the creation and destruction of `Frames`,

- a `Block` to handle Python block management on to which control flow and loops
  are mapped.

### Virtual machine

Each value of a `pygo.VM` must store the call stack, the Python
exception state and the return values as they flow between frames:

```go
type VM struct {
	frames Frames    // call stack of Frames
	fp     *Frame    // pointer to current Frame
	ret    Value     // return value
	exc    Exception // last exception
}
```

A `pygo.VM` value can run bytecode with the `RunCode` method:

```go
func (vm *VM) RunCode(code Code, globals, locals map[string]Value) (Value, error) {
	frame := vm.makeFrame(code, globals, locals, vm.fp)
	return vm.runFrame(frame)
}
```
